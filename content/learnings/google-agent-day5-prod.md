# Day 5: Prototype to Production

## Scaling Up
Moving from a notebook demo to a production service.

## Agent2Agent (A2A)

- **Orchestrator**: A manager agent distributing tasks.
- **Workers**: Specialized agents (Coder, Researcher, Reviewer).
- **Hand-off**: Seamlessly transferring context between agents to solve complex goals.
