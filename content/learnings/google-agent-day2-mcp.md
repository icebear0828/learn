# Day 2: Tools and Interoperability

## The Power of Tools
Agents need hands. Tools allow them to fetch real-time data and perform actions.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
A standardized way to connect AI models to data sources.
- **Client**: The agent (e.g., Claude, Gemini)
- **Host**: The application
- **Server**: The data provider (e.g., Google Drive, Slack)
